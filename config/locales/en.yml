# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        <p class="govuk-body">The purpose of the PAP is to allow you to request a report from the Subsidy Advice Unit (SAU) evaluating your assessment of a subsidy or subsidy scheme against the subsidy control requirements set out in the Subsidy Control Act 2022 (Act), including the subsidy control principles.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In line with the requirements of the Act the SAU will notify you within <b>5 working days</b> of receiving your completed referral whether it will proceed to prepare  a report.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In reaching that decision, the SAU will consider whether your request complies with the submission requirements of the Act and, for certain subsidies or subsidy schemes of interest, whether the SAU has decided to prioritise your referral in accordance with its prioritisation principles.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We will set out in more detail the next steps in this response.</p>
